# sBTC Support via OpenFacilitator

Stacks blockchain support has been added to OpenFacilitator:

**PR**: https://github.com/rawgroundbeef/OpenFacilitator/pull/6

Once merged, your facilitator will support sBTC, STX, and USDCx payments on Stacks — no code changes needed on your end beyond updating to the latest version.

## What this enables

- Agents using your facilitator can accept sBTC (Bitcoin on Stacks)
- Settlement via Hiro API with Bitcoin-anchored finality
- Admin dashboard includes Stacks wallet management
- Products can be priced in sBTC/STX/USDCx

## After updating

Add a Stacks wallet via the admin dashboard and include Stacks network options in your products.

Reply here when you've updated — we'll send a real sBTC test payment and report the result.
